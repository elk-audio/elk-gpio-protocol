# Gpio ProtocolProtocol and library to control Gpios in Elk Audio OS devices, which provides anabstract interface for low level gpio control.The protocol allows for describing various physical devices connected on thepins such as buttons, leds, pots etc, configuring their behavior and run time manipulation and querying of their values. This enables a high level program(such as [sensei](https://github.com/elk-audio/sensei/)) to control gpios by communicating with the gpio protocol to with an low level program such as an embedded system which performs the gpio logic.## Gpio Client LibraryReal time safe header only library to perform low level gpio logic andcommunicate using the gpio protocol as per the specification (see docs).This can be used as a bare metal application in an embedded device or as astandalone program and communicate with another program (such as [sensei](https://github.com/elk-audio/sensei/)) which acts as the gpio protocolmaster.#### Importing into your projectAdd the subdirectory gpio_protocol to your CMakeLists.txt `add_subdirectory(gpio_protocol)`#### Cmake Build OptionsTo enable the client library pass `-DGPIO_PROTOCOL_BUILD_CLIENT_LIB=TRUE` to your cmake. You can also set the log level to info, warning or error by passing the cmakeoption `-DGPIO_LOG_LEVEL=< info, warning or error>`#### UsageSee the project [SENSEI](https://github.com/elk-audio/sensei/) where thislibrary is used to process gpio data from shift registers. Copyright 2019 Modern Ancient Instruments Networked AB, dba Elk, Stockholm
